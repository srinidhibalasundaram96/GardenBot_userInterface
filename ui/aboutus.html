            We, Students of SNS College of Technology, wanted to help<br>
            society by providing Engineering solutions. We decided to <br>
            build a product that would help the people to improve their<br>
            life style. We got inspired by the idea of <a href="https://farmbot.io">Farmbot</a>-<br>
            an open source project and commited ourselves to replicate the <br>
            idea with some modifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is to help people grow food on their home wihthout <br>
            spending a lot of time for it. We have made the idea come <br>
            true with great efforts.<br>
